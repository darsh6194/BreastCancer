## Introduction

This project aims to predict the likelihood of breast cancer using machine learning algorithms. By analyzing various features in the provided dataset, the model can assist in early detection and treatment planning.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, scaling, and encoding.
- **Model Training**: Implementing various machine learning models.
- **Model Evaluation**: Accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
- **Visualization**: Data and result visualization.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the [Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+(Diagnostic)). It contains features computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass.

- **Features**: Mean, standard error, and worst value of cell nuclei measurements.
- **Labels**: Diagnosis (M = malignant, B = benign).

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/breast-cancer-prediction.git
   cd breast-cancer-prediction
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```sh
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install the required packages:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. *Data Preprocessing*:
  
   ```

2.
